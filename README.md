# Neural-Net
To gain experience with implementing an artificial neural network and with the design choices that accompany using one.

# Requirements
Ran using Python 3.7.3

# Parameters
 The filename containing the training data.
    Can be modified under "GLOBAL VAR"
 The initial learning rate.
    Can be modified in perceptron constructor.
 The number of epochs.
    Can be modified in perceptron constructor.
 Whether to load in the initial weights for the neural network from a file or initialize them randomly
    Since its a perceptron, uses a constant 0 that changes as the program runs
